## Core Security Concepts with Use Cases

---

### What is the difference between authentication and authorization?

- **Authentication**: Verifies *who* the user is.
- **Authorization**: Determines *what* the user is allowed to do.

**Use Case**:  
A user logs into a banking portal (authentication). After login, they can check their balance but cannot approve loans (authorization).

---

### How does Spring Security handle the authentication flow for form login?

- Intercepts `/login` requests with `UsernamePasswordAuthenticationFilter`.
- Validates credentials using an `AuthenticationManager`.
- Stores authenticated details in `SecurityContextHolder`.

**Use Case**:  
Employees log in to an HR portal via a login form. Based on their roles, they can view payslips or manage payroll.

---

### How is a stateless JWT flow different from session-based authentication?

- **Session-based**: Server maintains session state for each user.
- **JWT-based**: No server state; JWT token contains user identity and is sent in each request.

**Use Case**:  
A mobile app uses JWT tokens for every API call. The server doesnâ€™t store sessions, making the app scalable and stateless.

---

### How do filters in Spring Security get executed and ordered?

- Spring uses a **filter chain** where each filter executes in a defined sequence.
- Custom filters like `JwtAuthenticationFilter` are registered before/after standard filters.

**Use Case**:  
A JWT filter runs before `UsernamePasswordAuthenticationFilter` to intercept API requests and extract tokens from headers.

---

### What role does the `SecurityContextHolder` play?

- Stores the current `Authentication` object for the request thread.
- Allows access to user identity and roles throughout the application.

**Use Case**:  
After login, business services access the authenticated user from `SecurityContextHolder` to log actions or apply role-based rules.

---

### Why should CSRF be disabled for JWT-based APIs?

- CSRF protection targets cookie-based sessions.
- JWT is passed in headers (not automatically by the browser), making CSRF irrelevant.

**Use Case**:  
A frontend sends JWT in `Authorization` header. Since headers canâ€™t be forged in cross-site requests, CSRF isnâ€™t needed.

---

### What is MDC and how does it help with audit/log tracing?

- MDC (Mapped Diagnostic Context) allows adding contextual data (like `traceId`, `username`) to logs.
- Helps correlate logs for a single request across services.

**Use Case**:  
A request to `/api/user` logs the `traceId` and `username`, making it easy to debug issues and trace user actions across services.

---

### What are the security risks of not validating a JWT token signature?

- JWTs can be tampered with if the signature is not verified.
- Attackers can forge tokens to impersonate users or gain elevated privileges.

**Use Case**:  
If someone modifies the JWT payload to add `ROLE_ADMIN` and the server doesnâ€™t validate the signature, they could access sensitive endpoints.

---

### How can you revoke or expire JWTs?

- Use short expiration times.
- Revoke tokens using blacklists or by rotating the signing secret.

**Use Case**:  
If a user logs out or is deactivated, their JWT can still be used unless itâ€™s expired or blacklisted.

---

### What is the purpose of enabling or customizing CORS?

- CORS allows or restricts browser-based requests from different origins.
- Necessary for enabling frontend-backend communication in modern web apps.

**Use Case**:  
Your frontend app on `http://localhost:3000` calls the backend on `http://localhost:8080`. CORS needs to be enabled to allow this communication.
