# Observability Stack for Spring Boot Microservices - Day 5

Author: Aman Jha  

## Stack Overview

This project sets up an **observability stack** for microservices using Docker Compose. It includes:

- **Elasticsearch**: Log storage and search engine
- **Logstash**: Log processing pipeline
- **Kibana**: Visualization for logs
- **Prometheus**: Metrics collection
- **Grafana**: Metrics dashboards
- **Zipkin**: Distributed tracing
- **Spring Cloud Sleuth**: Trace instrumentation for Spring Boot

## Core Observability Concepts

Understanding observability in microservices requires clear distinction between metrics, logs, and traces, and how tools like **Micrometer**, **Sleuth**, **Zipkin**, **Kibana**, and **Grafana** help you track and debug distributed systems. Below are core questions with practical insights and real-world use cases.

### üîπ What are the differences between metrics, logs, and traces?

| Type     | Purpose                                    | Granularity      | Example |
|----------|--------------------------------------------|------------------|---------|
| Metrics  | Numerical measurements over time           | System-level     | CPU usage, request latency, GC time |
| Logs     | Time-stamped textual events                | Event-level      | ‚ÄúUser login failed: 401 Unauthorized‚Äù |
| Traces   | End-to-end request lifecycle across services| Request-level    | Trace of an API call from gateway ‚Üí auth ‚Üí DB service |

**Use Case:**  
- Metrics help with **alerting** (e.g., high memory usage).
- Logs help with **debugging** ("Why did this transaction fail?").
- Traces help with **performance bottleneck analysis** (which microservice is slow?).

---

### üîπ What‚Äôs the role of Micrometer and how does it enable backend-agnostic metrics?

**Micrometer** is a facade that decouples metric instrumentation from the monitoring backend. You write metrics once using Micrometer, and export to **Prometheus**, **Datadog**, **New Relic**, or **Graphite**, by simply changing the dependency.

**Use Case:**  
If your service runs in multiple environments (local: Prometheus, production: Datadog), you don‚Äôt rewrite instrumentation code. Just change `MicrometerRegistry`.

---

### üîπ How do `traceId` and `spanId` travel across microservice boundaries?

They are propagated through **HTTP headers** (usually `X-B3-TraceId`, `X-B3-SpanId`, etc.) injected by Sleuth or OpenTelemetry.

**Use Case:**  
A frontend request generates `traceId=abc123`. As the request flows from API Gateway ‚Üí Auth Service ‚Üí Payment Service, all services log and tag events with this `traceId`, enabling full request tracing in Zipkin/Grafana Tempo.

---

### üîπ How does Sleuth propagate context in WebClient/RestTemplate?

Spring Cloud Sleuth automatically **injects and extracts tracing headers** in:

- `RestTemplate` via `RestTemplateCustomizer`
- `WebClient` via `ExchangeFilterFunction`

**Use Case:**  
When Service A calls Service B via `WebClient`, Sleuth ensures the trace continues by passing `traceId` in headers, enabling consistent distributed tracing without manual coding.

---

### üîπ What is the difference between `Timer`, `Gauge`, and `Counter` in Micrometer?

| Type    | Purpose                          | Mutable? | Example |
|---------|----------------------------------|----------|---------|
| Timer   | Measures duration + rate         | ‚úÖ        | `@Timed` on method to track execution time |
| Gauge   | Instantaneous measurement        | ‚úÖ        | Current thread count in pool |
| Counter | Monotonically increasing value   | ‚ùå        | Number of logins, API hits |

**Use Case:**
- Use `Timer` to monitor method execution (e.g., `processPayment()` time).
- Use `Gauge` for real-time pool size monitoring.
- Use `Counter` to track rate of failed logins over time.

---

### üîπ What is MDC and how does it help with log correlation?

**MDC (Mapped Diagnostic Context)** stores per-thread context like `traceId`, `userId`, etc., to be automatically included in log patterns.

**Use Case:**
```java
MDC.put("traceId", traceId);
log.info("Order failed");
```

**Log Output:**
```java
INFO [traceId=abc123] Order failed
```

### üîπ What is the difference between structured vs unstructured logging?

| Type         | Format     | Searchable? | Example                                                   |
|--------------|------------|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| Structured   | JSON       | ‚úÖ           | `{ "level": "INFO", "user": "Aman", "action": "login" }` |
| Unstructured | Plain text | ‚ùå (harder) | `"User Aman logged in successfully"`                      |

**Use Case:**  
Structured logs allow **Kibana queries** like:

### üîπ How do you use Kibana to search for logs tied to a specific `traceId`?

1. Ensure logs are indexed with `traceId` (via MDC or Sleuth).
2. In Kibana Discover tab, search:
```java
traceId:"abc123"
```

3. Visualize logs from all microservices involved in that trace.

**Use Case:**  
Quickly identify if a user request failed in Gateway, Auth, or DB layer without hopping across multiple logs.

---

### üîπ How can you monitor memory, DB pool, and request error rates in Grafana?

- **Memory:**  
Use `jvm.memory.used` from Micrometer + Prometheus.

- **DB Pool:**  
Expose HikariCP metrics like `hikaricp.connections.active`.

- **Request Error Rate:**  
- Use counters for: http.server.requests{status="5xx"}


**Use Case:**  
Alert if:
- Memory usage > 80%
- DB pool exceeds max size
- Error rate > 2% over 5 mins

---

### üîπ How does sampling affect Zipkin trace accuracy and performance?

Sampling controls the % of requests that get traced (e.g., 10%).

| Benefit                  | Risk                  |
|--------------------------|------------------------|
| Less performance overhead| May miss key traces    |
| Good for high TPS systems| Incomplete visibility  |

**Use Case:**  
For production systems with 10,000 RPS, tracing only 10% keeps Zipkin performant while still offering insight into bottlenecks. But for debugging incidents, increase sample rate temporarily to 100%.
